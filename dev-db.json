Incidence angles were varied in order to cross-calibrate the Oceansat-2 and RapidScat scatterometers and to extend the known Ku-band geophysical model function. The averaging of the L1B input data combined with the wind vector processing results are both contained in this product referred to hereafter as Level 1C (L1C). The fixed and repointed beam processing is relative to either the one corresponding to the vertically polarized \"outer\" beam or the other corresponding to the horizontally polarized \"inner\" beam. The Sigma-0 values from the fixed operating beam for each frame are averaged to a single value representing approximately 50 samples. The data points are land flagged, collocated with ECMWF surface winds, and have climatological nadir attenuations provided for the location and time of the data (not applied to the sigma0). For orbits prior to 87727 the RapidSCAT geophysical model function (GMF) has been used to compute wind speed and direction, which is provided at each discrete sampling point corresponding to the averaged Sigma-0 locations. From orbit 87727 to present, a newer GMF designed specifically to determine wind speed from QuikSCAT backscatter and ECMWF wind direction was employed. The wind speed were computed from QuikSCAT Sigma0 values by assuming the ECMWF wind direction as a first step and then refining those directions slightly to minimize differences between ECMWF and QuikSCAT wind vectors. Retrieved wind directions, thus obtained, were reported but are only slightly different from ECMWF values and should not be considered an independent measurement of wind direction. Retrieved wind speeds do not depend significantly on ECMWF speeds as evidenced by the fact that they agree closely with WindSAT polarimetric radiometer speeds whenever WindSAT and ECMWF disagree. The Sigma0 values have also been corrected for scan loss (due to the fact that the antenna does not scan) and for X-factor changes due to repointing. At a later date, the historical L1C data will be reprocessed to utilize the newer GMF.",

    "description": "This is the PI-produced JPL SMAP-SSS V4.0, level 2B CAP, validated sea surface salinity and extreme winds orbital/swath product from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) observatory. It is based on the Combined Active-Passive (CAP) retrieval algorithm developed at JPL originally in the context of Aquarius/SAC-D and now extended to SMAP. The JPL SMAP-SSS L2B CAP product includes data for a range of parameters: derived SMAP sea surface salinity (SSS) and wind speed/direction data for extreme winds, brightness temperatures for each radiometer polarization, ancillary reference surface salinity, wind and wave height data, quality flags, and navigation data. Each data file covers one 98-minute orbit (15 files per day). Data begins on April 1,2015 and is ongoing, with a 3 day latency in processing and availability. Observations are global in extent and provided at 25km swath grid with an approximate spatial resolution of 60 km. Improvements with this V4.0 dataset include: addition of estimated SSS uncertainty, improvement of TB correction for high latitudes, modification of the land correction range to 1000 km from coast, change of the ancillary wind source from NCEP GDAS to NCEP GFS resulting in signifcant improvements in SSS retrievals near storms, extension of the range of SSS retrievals to 45 PSU, and SSS retrievals also for large inland seas. The SMAP satellite is in a near-polar orbit at an inclination of 98 degrees and an altitude of 685 km. It has an ascending node time of 6 pm and is sun-synchronous. With its 1000km swath, SMAP achieves global coverage in approximately 3 days, but has an exact orbit repeat cycle of 8 days. On board Instruments include a highly sensitive L-band radiometer operating at 1.41GHz and an L-band 1.26GHz radar sensor providing complementary active and passive sensing capabilities. Malfunction of the SMAP scatterometer on 7 July, 2015, has necessitated the use of collocated wind speed for the surface roughness correction required for the surface salinity retrieval.",

    "description": "This dataset contains operational near-real-time Level 2 coastal ocean surface wind vector retrievals from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) on MetOp-A at 12.5 km sampling resolution (note: the effective resolution is 25 km). It is a product of the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) provided through the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). This coastal dataset differs from the standard 25 km datasets in that it utilizes a spatial box filter (rather than the Hamming filter) to generate a spatial average of the Sigma-0 retrievals from the Level 1B dataset; all full resolution Sigma-0 retrievals within a 15 km radius of the wind vector cell centroid are used in the averaging. Since the full resolution L1B Sigma-0 retrievals are used, all non-sea retrievals are discarded prior to the Sigma-0 averaging. Each box average Sigma-0 is then used to compute the wind vector cell using the same CMOD7.n geophysical model function as in the standard OSI SAF ASCAT wind vector datasets. With this enhanced coastal retrieval, winds can be computed as close to ~15 km from the coast, as compared to the static ~35 km land mask in the standard 12.5 km dataset. Each file is provided in netCDF version 3 format, and contains one full orbit derived from 3-minute orbit granules. Latency is approximately 2 hours from the latest measurement. The beginning of the orbit is defined by the first wind vector cell measurement within the first 3-minute orbit granule that starts north of the Equator in the ascending node. ASCAT is a C-band dual fan beam radar scatterometer providing two independent swaths of backscatter retrievals in sun-synchronous polar orbit aboard the MetOp-A platform.

    "description": "The rising and falling of the sea, \u201cthe tides,\u201d are a phenomenon upon which we can always depend. Caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, tides are very long-period waves that move through the ocean and progress toward the coastlines where they appear as the regular rise and fall of the sea surface. The same happens in the Great Lakes, although the largest tides in the Great Lakes are only about 5 cm and are mostly impacted by precipitation, evaporation and runoff.\r\n\r\nCO-OPS maintains the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON), an observation network with more than 200 permanent water level stations on the coasts and Great Lakes. This system allows NOAA to provide the official tidal predictions for the nation. Accurate water level data is critical for safe and efficient marine navigation and for the protection of infrastructure along the coast. The NWLON also provides the national standards for tide and water level reference datums used for nautical charting, coastal engineering, international treaty regulation, and boundary determination. The NWLON is also widely recognized as the key federal component of the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS).",

The NWM simulates the water cycle with mathematical representations of the different processes and how they fit together. This complex representation of physical processes such as snowmelt and infiltration and movement of water through the soil layers varies significantly with changing elevations, soils, vegetation types and a host of other variables. Additionally, extreme variability in precipitation over short distances and times can cause the response on rivers and streams to change very quickly. Overall, the process is so complex that to simulate it with a mathematical model means that it needs a very high powered computer or super computer in order to run in the time frame needed to support decision makers when flooding is threatened.\r\n\r\nThe NWM complements current hydrologic modeling which is done in a simplified manner for approximately 4000 locations across the CONUS by providing information at a very fine spatial and temporal scale at those locations, as well as for locations that don\u2019t have a traditional river forecast.",

Apart from having state\u2013of\u2013the-art physics, these models can be run in unstructured grid formulation, a key requirement for seamlessly simulating inundation processes at small spatial scales along the coast.

The wave model chosen as part of developing this modeling system is the WAVEWATCH III wave model \u2013 a State-Of-the-Art community wave modeling system whose development is managed by NOAA. The wave model is a sophisticated modeling system with numerous developments that have been added in recent years (wave \u2013 hurricane interaction physics, unstructured grid formulation, new wave growth and dissipation physics packages, wave \u2013 mud and wave \u2013 bottom interaction physics to name a few) that make this model attractive for this project. Being a community model with a very active international team of wave developers also allows us to partner and leverage resources. In this project we will partner with the USACE towards the development of a more efficient numerical solver for the WAVEWATCH III model that will make it possible to carry out wave simulations in very high resolution domains with extensive computational grids \u2013 a necessary condition for accurate simulations of total inundation. The USACE has a common interest in developing the WAVEWATCH III model as a coastal wave model and thus resources will be pooled for this development. Since the WAVEWATCH III modeling system is very modular and maintained on a subversion repository, development of the numerical engine can be done in parallel with the wave \u2013 surge coupling work (see statement of work on wave coupling) with incremental improvements to the numerical engine being provided to the coupled system for testing at regular intervals."

The model system will be validated for previous hurricane events for which (1) damage from the storm\u2019s inundation led to incidents of buildings being destroyed to their foundation (i.e. \u201cslab\u201d scenarios), and (2) more data on total water level recordings are available to validate the model performance, and (3) pre-existing unstructured triangular grids are available for use, with little or no modifications, in the hindcast simulations. For this project, skill assessment techniques and criteria will be determined that will be consistent with the goal of the COASTAL Act to have models that are 90% accurate. This project will also support coupling to WAVEWATCHIII on an unstructured grid system, critical to achieving the 90% requirement for water levels. The two modeling systems will be dynamically coupled to exchange physical processes so as to obtain accurate estimates of total wave\u2013surge induced inundation. Coupling strategy will be based on long term aligning with overall NOAA plans for coupled modeling as well as being cognizant of deliverable schedules. At those locations where data are available for the hurricane hindcast scenarios, the performance of the coupled model will be evaluated using the skill assessment techniques. While an updated Hurricane Surge On-Demand Forecast System (HSOFS) grid is in development, separate pre-existing grids with higher local refinement and overland coverage will also be used in this assessment to fully evaluate the model resolution requirements for the COASTAL Act."

The grid would be based on modification to the existing Hurricane Surge On-demand Forecast System (HSOFS) unstructured triangular grid. The current HSOFS grid covers the entire Gulf of Mexico and extends into the Atlantic Ocean to the approximate longitude of 65W, allowing for appropriate generation of storm surge from atmospheric effects over a large region. Nearshore, the grid extends on to land up to a topographic height of 10m using an overland grid resolution of approximately 200m. This grid will be modified in the nearshore and overland areas to improve the NSEM\u2019s ability to meet the COASTAL Act\u2019s requirements, as determined by model testing. The grid will also be adjusted to (1) better represent features in regions vulnerable to inundation and (2) incorporate and better reflect new bathymetry and topography made available through other Bathymetry/Topography projects. The final modifications to the HSOFS grid will be tested with the ADCIRC-WaveWatch III coupled model system to ensure numerical soundness and stability."

The comparison of existing modern DEMs with up-to-date available source topographic and bathymetric data will help inform the process of determining area(s) of interest for proposed DEM development.

The HWRF executes operationally at 2 km resolution near the tropical cyclone\u2019s center where the strongest winds are usually found. The URMA and HWRF systems can provide a consistent starting point for the NSEM wind analyses since they are of comparable resolution.\r\n\r\nA two-year effort will generate wind and surface pressure analysis by running the HWRF system retrospectives for the selected storms.

To ensure full interoperability with both Covered Data sources as well as the NSEM, it is critical that the CWWED be developed and configured concurrently with the development of the NSEM. In order to achieve this integrated functionality, several things must happen. First, the database structure itself must be developed as a federated database environment. It must then be populated by indexing all existing Covered Data sources and developing (Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that facilitate the seamless and high-speed transfer, reformatting, and packaging of Covered Data from the data sources to the requestor (e.g., NSEM). As a \u201cfederated\u201d database, the CWWED will not house any covered data itself, but rather will act as a virtual database, providing real-time access to covered data as though they were physically housed within the database itself. However, this may require the negotiation and implementation of data sharing agreements or service level agreements between NOAA and external Covered Data sources. The output from the NSEM, while also flowing through the CWWED, would be physically archived on servers at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), unless an alternative archival repository is identified for this purpose. When properly configured, this distinction is transparent to users. To ensure that the NSEM is able to request and retrieve all required covered data from the CWWED, and that the CWWED can, an API needs to be developed that intrinsically links the NSEM to the CWWED."
